/*Advantage of Singleton design pattern
Saves memory because object is not created at each request. Only single instance is reused again and again.
Usage of Singleton design pattern
Singleton pattern is mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications. It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.
